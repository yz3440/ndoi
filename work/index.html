        <p>
          The Nomadic Department of the Interior (NDOI) is a research art
          collective that seeks to address, in films, websites, and
          publications, the conflicting interests between stewardship of lands &
          extraction of material and cultural resources. Our research
          investigates technological systems against the backdrop of geological,
          ecological and human history.

        <p><b>Caches From The Landscape</b>, 2021</p>

        <p>
          In the winter of 2019 and summer of 2021, art and research collective
          The Nomadic Department of the Interior (NDOI) traveled to the
          southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou to investigate the impacts of
          big data infrastructural development on the people and landscape.
          <i>Caches from the Landscape</i> is a short film in the form of a
          visual travelogue. Starting from a post-industrial village—a relic of
          the Third Front Movement—the film travels to relocation villages of
          people displaced by the world’s largest radio telescope and continues
          on to data centers tunneled into mountains and new tech plazas in
          China’s Big Data Valley. In these brief fragments, the film captures a
          changing landscape, past memories and new monuments. Various human and
          non-human encounters give a glimpse of the current moment: the
          continuous arrival of big data infrastructure development and how it
          is reshaping histories, topologies and collective identity.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The Nomadic Department of the Interior (NDOI) is a research collective that seeks to address, in films,
        websites,
        and publications, the conflicting interests between stewardship of lands & extraction of material and cultural
        resources. Our research investigates technological systems against the backdrop of geological, ecological and
        human history.</p>

      <p>Our <a href="#members">members</a> are currently based in mainland China and Taiwan.</p>

        of work about the collision of technology and rural places.</p>
